# Unit_3_Tutorial_1

This is the tutorial code from https://medium.com/wesionary-team/create-your-first-rest-api-with-node-js-express-and-mongodb-447fce535385 and I created this repository for education purposes. I have implemented and successfully tested the GET/POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints that this tutorial covers.
